# Introduction

Thank you for considering helping out with the PEAK Assistant. The more ideas and input we have from the threat hunting community, the better the assistant can be!

This file contains some general guidelines for how to interact with and contribute to the project. We ask that you follow them as closely as possible in order to help the contribution process go as smoothly as possible. 

As an application created by threat hunters for other threat hunters, the Assistant can greatly benefit from all different types of contributions. Some examples of contributions include:

* Reporting bugs
* Fixing bugs
* Adding new features
* Improving the prompts
* Adding to or clarifying the documentation
* Publishing tutorial or "HOWTO" information

Notice that not everything on that list has to do with coding or AI. Even if your talents lay elsewhere, if you're hunting at all, you have the skills needed to make a contribution! 

That said, please don't use our contribution processes or GitHub issue trackers to ask for support. At this time, we are still investigating how best to provide support. 

# Contribution Rules

The most important rule of all is *be respectful*. Bullying, name calling, bigotry, or other forms of harassment will not be tolerated. 

Other key rules:

* The project is written in Python, so please try to stick to that language for new contributions. Anything that requires adding a new language, framework, or technology to the stack is going to be viewed with skepticism at best.
* Our primary development platform is MacOS, though the Assistant runs on both Linux and Windows as well. Please try to be cognizant of the multi-platform compatibility of any contribution. We'd hate to reject something just because it only works on certain platforms.
* If you're considering contributing a new feature or fixing a complex bug, please open a discussion in the issue tracker first. Explain what you intend to do and why, and let's talk about it. There's nothing more discouraging than pouring your soul into a PR only to have it rejected.
* Please try to limit the number of bug fixes or features to one per PR where feasible. Combining several into one PR may make sense if they are closely related, but otherwise it's best for all concerned if we can accept, revise, or reject them on their individual merits.

# Unsure how to contribute?

If you'd like to help out but are unsure where to start, reporting bugs with enough details to enable us to reproduce them is always a great way to start! Other options include:

* Fixing the bug you just reporting and submitting a PR
* Suggesting rewrites to parts of the documentation that didn't seem clear to you
* Adding FAQ or Troubleshooting entries to README.md
* Participating in the discussion on existing issues

A project like the PEAK Assistant relies on good interaction with and feedback from its users, so don't be shy to engage us!
