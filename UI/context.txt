Splunk hints:
    If you encounter base64-encoded data, and if you decide that you must decode it,
    you can use the following sample command as a reference:
        | makeresults
        | eval encoded="bnByb2Mg"
        | code field=encoded method=base64 action=decode destfield=decoded
        | table encoded, decoded
