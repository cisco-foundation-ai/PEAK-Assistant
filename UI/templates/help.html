    <li>
        <strong>Topic Research</strong><br>
        Enter a topic, threat actor technique, or behavior in the input box and click <b>Generate Research Report</b>.<br>
        <b>Example:</b> <code>Kerberoasting</code> or <code>Initial Access via Phishing</code>.<br>

    </li>
    <li class="mt-3">
        <strong>Hypothesis Generation</strong><br>
        Review the research report and select or edit a hypothesis from the dropdown. Hypotheses are generated based on your research.<br>
        <b>Example:</b> <code>Kerberoasting attacks can be detected by monitoring for abnormal service ticket requests.</code>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-3">
        <strong>Hypothesis Refinement (Optional)</strong><br>
        Refine your selected hypothesis for clarity and actionability. The system will suggest improvements, or you can edit manually.<br>
        <b>Example:</b> <code>Monitor for a high volume of Kerberos service ticket requests from a single host as a potential indicator of Kerberoasting.</code>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-3">
        <strong>Generate ABLE Table</strong><br>
        Generate an ABLE Table based on your (refined) hypothesis. The table will help guide your threat hunting activities.<br>
